# Revity: Web Developer, Vtuber, Nerd

‚ö†Ô∏è Hi, I'm Revity! ü¶å

Hello there! I assume that if you're reading this introduction, you know about me from the Vtuber side of things. In case you are not, allow me to introduce myself!
My name is Revity, and I am a thirsty deer girl Vtuber. I stream part time on Twitch at https://twitch.tv/Revity, where I play a variety of games
such as Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and FFXIV.

I also happen to have studied computer science and I recently earned my Bachlor of Science in CS. Up until now, I have kept my developer life and Vtuber life separate,
but I very recently decided to try offering web development commissions to bring in some extra money. As a result, I decided to create this GitHub account to make a portfolio for
Revity the web developer (which is hilarious to read).

If you want more information about me and my work, you can check out the following:

I hope you enjoy your time here! I can be contacted at Twitter (@RevityRime) if you'd like to reach out.
